            <h3>Website Build</h3>
            <p>
                Now there was nothing left to do except commence the build. After seeking some advice from the front-enders at Humaan about where to start and how to structure the document, I dug into VSCode. After about 3 weeks of building, the finished result can be seen here.

        <section class="outcomes">
            <h2>Outcomes and Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Due to the scope of this project, <strong>I encountered many hurdles.</strong> Some of which were easily overcome and others had the devs scratching their heads too. 
                <br><br>
                I believe that <strong>the measure of success for this project is a self-reflective one.</strong> I will attempt to answer it as conscisely as I can in the follow 3 questions. 
            </p>
            <h3>Was the design process a challenge?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, yes it was. I felt that I was under a lot of pressure to propose a highly considered approach. Being my first step into an agency environment and being surrounded by talented designers and developers was both the biggest help, but also the source of a lot of the pressure.
                <br><br>
                Receiving feedback throughout the design process was the key to the creation of the final designs. I have gained a massive respect for the power of feedback and collaboration and will endevour to use it whenever I can in the future. 
                <br><br>
                Presenting to the team at Humaan was hugely rewarding as not only did I receive expert feedback and advice, but I gained experience explaining and justifying my design choices. I gained a lot of confidence in my ability to design well, and to listen to critique. 
            </p>
            <h3>Did I learn new practices, techniques or skills while prototyping and building?</h3>
            <p>
                Of course I did. While designing I tried not to tie myself down within what I knew to be my limitations of coding ability. Instead I pushed myself to learn what I needed to to replicate my designs in code as close as possible. 
                <br><br>
                Refining my usage of code like flex-box and GSAP were only one part of my successes. I also taught myself to code an accordion menu from scratch, and built a infinite scroll loop function with the help of a few of the devs (although this one had everyone scratching their heads for a while).
            </p>
            <h3>Was it fun?</h3>
            <p>
                It was great! I genuinely enjoyed the challenge throughout the entire process. I had a lot of fun learning about new technologies and code snippets that could help and completing the final build was very rewarding.
